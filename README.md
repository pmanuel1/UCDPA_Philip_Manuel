# DataAnalyticsUCD
Develop a Python project to analyse real world scenarios and generate valuable insights by
visualising information. The project aims to analyse data from different data sources,
manipulate information and visualise to generate insights.

Abstract
This paper/project provides a description and is a supplement to this authors Data Analytics Essentials Python project.  
The project is based on the information held in two Datasets that relate to bank failures and unemployment.  
The purpose of the project was to show an ability to use Python, complete the three deliverables (project ZIP, Project Report, GitHub Repository URL), identify insights into the data itself, and create some visualisations.
During the coding process, I set out to complete each task as outlined in the assessment brief and I hoped to
 give clear explanations within the code to aid the end user understand the rationale for the process.  
The goal of the project was to demonstrate a capacity to put each course learning outcome into practice. 
Developing capacity to use a programing language is an ongoing task and there is always more to investigate, 
learn and reflect upon.  It is the opinion of this author that most of the learning topics have been covered.  
When working within the real-world datasets several shortcomings become apparent some in my current capacity to 
code what is a new language to me, and some with the reality of using real-world datasets and Python.
